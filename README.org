* Modelling and prediction for TEMP-LISP

This program is designed for interactive use in emacs.

It handles multi-class classification and regression workflows for predicting multiple crop
traits from time series remote sensing multi-spectral imagery.

It implements workflows for data processing, model training, prediction and
evaluation using the EO-learn library, LightGBM model and the TSAI Model library, as well as FastAI Library.

Evaluation is done with sci-kit learn. The visualizations and metrics are meant only for internal validation of the
data processing. Formal metrics should be made from the exported final prediction.

** Process

1. Data preparation:
   - Loads prepared drone imagery and field segmentation data
   - Creates EOPatches from drone imagery and metadata
   - Samples data for training

2. Model training:
   - Trains GBM and TSAI models for regression and classification
   - Evaluates models on holdout test set

3. Prediction:
   - Applies trained models to validation area
   - Visualizes and quantifies predictions

4. Export:
   - Exports prediction maps as GeoTIFFs

** Data Flow

1. Input Files:
   - Drone imagery tiffs (DATA_RASTERS)
   - Area of interest polygons (DATA_AREAS)
   - Field identity polygons (DATA_IDS)
   - Trait observations table (DATA_TABLE)

2. Data Preparation:
   - Create EOPatches from Drone imagery
   - Add metadata (timestamps, masks) to EOPatches
   - Sample data from EOPatches

3. Model Training:
   - Split sampled data into train/test sets
   - Train GBM and TSAI models (classification and/or regression)
   - Evaluate models on test set

4. Prediction:
   - Load validation area EOPatches
   - Apply trained models to predict trait
   - Store predictions in EOPatches

5. Evaluation:
   - Calculate metrics comparing predictions to ground truth
   - Generate visualizations of predictions and errors

6. Export:
   - Extract predictions from EOPatches
   - Merge predictions into single raster
   - Export as GeoTIFF

Output Files:
- Predicted trait GeoTIFF (RESULTS_DIR)
- Model files (MODELS_DIR)
